	<h1>Reimagine Giving Terms and Conditions</h1>
<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3><br/>
<p>
1.1 This document is an electronic record in terms of Information Technology Act, 2000 and rules thereunder as applicable and the amended provisions pertaining to electronic records in various statutes as amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signatures.
<br/><br/>

1.2 This document is published in accordance with the provisions of Rule 3(1) of the Information Technology(Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 that require publishing the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for access or usage of the website, www.reimaginegiving.org
<br/><br/>

1.3 Reimagine Giving Foundation is <span class="fontBold">registered as a not-for-profit company u/s 25 of the Companies Act, 1956.(dated. February 7, 2017),</span> with the RoC, Uttar Pradesh.(“Reimagine”, and together with Reimagine Giving,“RG” or“us” or“we”). Reimagine operates an online donation service website(“Website”) providing various services(“Services”), including the collection and processing of donations received(the“Donations”) from individual donors(the“Donors”),  transferring Donations to different non-profit organisations or individual project organisers and creating reports on the project. Reimagine also administers grant programs independently from the Website. 
<br/><br/>

1.4 These legal terms and conditions, in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable govern the use of the Services(“Terms of Service”) by the non-profit organisations(together referred to as the“Nonprofits” and each individually as a“Nonprofit”) and individuals(together referred to as“Individuals” and each individually as an“Individual”) together referred to as“Organisers” and each individually as an“Organiser” that are registered as Registered Users with Reimagine(as defined in clause 2.2 below). By registering and continuing to use or access the Website, you are agreeing as an Organiser to be bound by these Terms of Service with immediate effect. References in these Terms of Service to the“Organiser” or“you”(and similar) are references to you as a organiser or to any other eligible organisation that has applied on your behalf to Reimagine and/or has been registered by Reimagine as a Registered User(as defined in clause 2.2).
</p><br/><br/><br/>

<h3>2. REGISTRATION</h3><br>
<p>



2.1 Organisers are eligible to register as a Registered User and benefit from the Services provided by Reimagine either via its Website or other programs administered offline. 
<br/><br/>

2.2 Once you have successfully completed the registration process(including but not limited to completion of the Due Diligence Process set out in clause 2.5), you will be deemed a“Registered User”, and your registration shall continue for an indefinite period, subject to the satisfaction of any subsequent due diligence in accordance with clause 9, termination rights in accordance with clause 15 and Reimagines suspension and withdrawal rights in accordance with clause 16. For the avoidance of doubt, once the registration process is complete, the Registered User will be deemed as authorised by the Organiser unless there is evidence indicating fraud, as determined by Reimagine. 
<br/><br/>

2.3 Reimagine receives Donations made through the Website and offline. Donations are made to Reimagine in their entirety and not to Organiser. Reimagine’s trustee’s retain sole discretion regarding the onward distribution of Donations, to Organisers(so as to ensure appropriate handling and compliance). 

<br/><br/>
2.4 By completing the registration process, you agree and acknowledge that: <br/>
 (a) Reimagine retains full control over the Donations and the Donations will be allocated to Reimagine’s general fund if(without limitation): <br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(i) a project is retired or fully funded; </span><br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(ii) Reimagine receives a Donation without reference to a specific project or campaign; </span><br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(iii) a Organiser does not have an active account due to not having completed the renewal Due Diligence Process required pursuant to clause 2.5 of these Terms of Service; </span><br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(iv) a Organiser does not provide correct disbursement information within a reasonable timeframe after at least two reminder emails having been sent to the Organiser to update or provide such disbursement information; </span><br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(v) a Organiser, through the Website, raises less than INR 10,000 net of any fees payable by the Organiser to Reimagine pursuant to clause 3 of these Terms of Service; or </span><br/>
   <span class="margin20left">(vi) Reimagine conducts an investigation of the Organiser and on the basis of the results of such investigation, decides to remove the Organiser from the Website. </span><br/>
 (b) Reimagine reserves the right to refuse to accept any Donation; <br/>
 (c) Reimagine initiates fundraising activities and appeals itself and may choose to make grants to a Organiser with funds it has itself raised. In this case, a Organiser may be invited by Reimagine to submit project details to indicate such Reimagine’s proposed use of such funds, but such projects might not be individually listed on the Website; <br/>
 (d) the Organiser and/or its projects may be included on Reimagine’s associated websites including any partner or client websites; <br/>
 (e) some Donors may use filter options on the Website(e.g. by a specific theme, region, size of projects, etc) which may result in some of a Organiser’s projects not being seen on the Website by such Donors; <br/>
 (f) Reimagine cannot ensure receipt of any minimum amounts of Donations and some or all of a Organiser’s projects may not receive any Donations; and <br/>
 (g) nothing in these Terms of Service shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between Reimagine and the Organiser and the Organiser is not authorised to enter into any commitments for or on behalf of Reimagine. 
<br/><br/>

2.5 Reimagine reserves the right to decline any registration, terminate any grant, and refuse or suspend Organiser or individual projects from being listed on the Website for any reason without further explanation. At the time of registration and at a minimum every two years thereafter, Reimagine will undertake such checks as are necessary to verify or re-verify the identity and objectives of the Organiser(the“Due Diligence Process”). 

<br/><br/>
2.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, Reimagine reserves the right to introduce new services and update or withdraw any of the Services, in its sole discretion, and will not be liable to the Nonprofit for exercising this discretion. 
<br/><br/>

2.7 If Reimagine decides to transfer Donations made by Donors, to the Organiser, you acknowledge that Reimagine will not be able to process such transfers until: <br/>
 (a) you have completed the registration process, have been accepted by Reimagine as a Registered User, have an account accessible via the Website<span class="fontBold">(“ReimagineOnline Account”)</span> and if required by Reimagine, have a publicly visible account<span class="fontBold">(“Project Page”)</span>; and <br/>
 (b) Reimagine’s systems have been updated to show that the Organiser is a Registered User and the Website has been set up to process payment transactions for the Organiser as a Registered User. 

</p><br/><br/><br/>
<h3>3. FEES </h3><br>

Reimagine reserves the right to require any organisation to submit documentation to Reimagine at any time to verify use of funds, confirm programmatic activity, or for other Due Diligence purposes.
